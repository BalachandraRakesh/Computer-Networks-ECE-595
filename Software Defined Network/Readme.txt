Working on this starter project was fun and challenging because we both have similar 
background (i.e. no previous network experience and not very experienced in writing large
program) therefore we contributed about equally the same and we learned from each other.

Personal Contribution:
- Mananga Mutombo's contribution was in getting the project started (i.e. writing the initial switch,
controller echo server); implementing register_response, register_request, keep alive,
command line arguments passing 

- Rakesh Balachandra's contribution was in implementing the widest_path algorithm from a 
Dijkstra algorithm, topology update to the controller, route table update.

We collectively worked on logging messages and switch faillure simulation.
